## Bagging

**Bagging 是什麼？**

Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm to improve classification and regression models in terms of stability and classification accuracy. It also reduces variance and helps to avoid 'overfitting'. Although it is usually applied to decision tree models, it can be used with any type of model. ([Decision Tree - Bagging](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/operators/modeling/predictive/trees/parallel_decision_tree.html))

簡單來說，Bagging 就是集結
